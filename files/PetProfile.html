That is in fact a deep laceration caused by a rope tightly wound around her neck. The close-up photos are a bit too graphic to post. No wonder she was cowering inside a box and hiding from our volunteers when she was rescued. Until now, it will take a bit of time and patience for new people to earn her trust." data-image-url="images/tali.jpg">

After being treated for her injuries, our shelter vet was unsure if she would walk again. Haley also remained aloof for a while, and we were unsure if she would ever get over her fear. Well, Haley put all our uncertainties to rest by bouncing back and being one of the friendliest dogs at the shelter.

He is a smart, trainable 1-yr-old Aspin who is still a bit skittish in unfamiliar surroundings. But just give him some time and love, and Post will show you his true, affectionate self. Post was recently rescued from a post office and we hope that he doesn’t wait too long for his forever home. He desperately needs a buddy or a family that will shower him with warmth and assure him that all is well in the world. We know that somewhere out there, there’s a human that can make him smile more often and show him that he has nothing to fear. We hope they get to meet at the AGJS shelter someday!" data-image-url="images/post.jpg">

Blessing is a highly energetic dog that needs time to bond with humans, being an 8-yr-old rescue that has been through rough times. He is getting a second chance as our volunteers work to socialize him further. We’re hoping that a foster parent or adopter will appreciate how far he has come and give him the chance to continue his rehabilitation in a home setting. When visiting the shelter to choose a new furry companion, please don’t count him out. He is getting old in years but still has plenty of zest, and he is ready for his forever home." data-image-url="images/blessing.jpg">

Kidding aside, some people love orange tabbies and can’t get enough of them, so AGJS presents yet another example of this type of appealing housecat with the orange and white fur. Bridget is timid and looks tired, so grab some cat toys or treats to perk him up. Cat owners who love cats jumping on the kitchen counters to join in for meal preparations will love Bridget Boy and his curious hunger for culinary treats. But he also has his bored, lazy cat moments, that is, until you invite him to play and cuddle." data-image-url="images/bridget.jpg">

Skyler’s most unique trait is his one odd eye. In fact, his eyes look different. They have different colors. No matter the disparity and uniqueness, Skyler is just like any cat who needs love and warmth. Use your soothing voice to call his name, and reward him with a treat when he responds. Skyler will become unique to you after you spend time with him at our cattery and he imprints with you after a good time. Cats are smart and they remember a loving human, so be that owner who he never forgets. Visit him today and get an unforgettable best friend." data-image-url="images/skyler.jpg">

What a long way a loving home does for an animal anxious about the environment at a shelter. Even if Cleo has resided in AGJS for more than two years, his anxiety about finding a fur-ever home increases annually, so we’re doing what we can to change that.
